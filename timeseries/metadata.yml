  methodSummary: >-
    The half degree gridded Jun-Aug PMDI reconstructions from Cook et al. (2010)
    were recalibrated using the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) 5km
    grid PMDI data. The 5km data were first upscaled to match the original
    half-degree grid. The recalibration was performed using a kernel density
    distribution mapping (KDDM) technique outlined in McGinnis et al. (2015)
    using an R-package provided by Seth McGinnis. The 50-year recalibration
    period used was 1929–1978 CE. The author’s also adjusted each grid point’s
    mean PMDI value for the recalibration period to be zero to avoid importing
    wet or dry bias into the recalibration. The recalibrated data set covers the
    continental United States just as the GHCN instrumental data does. Since
    instrumental data was used for 1979–2005 CE in the Cook dataset,
    recalibration applied only to the years 0–1978 CE. The 1979–2017
    instrumental years were filled in using data from NCEI’s GHCN 5km
    instrumental PMDI data.

    Digital elevation data at 3 arc second (approx. 90m) horizontal resolution
    and less than 16m vertical resolution. The data are provided by the NASA
    Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and the International Centre for
    Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), and are currently distributed free of charge by
    USGS and available for download through CGIAR at http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/.
  methodSummary: >-
    These data are provided by the Consortium for Spatial Information
    (CGIAR-CSI) of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural
    Research (CGIAR). The data are post-processed 3-arc second DEM data for the
    globe. The original SRTM (v1) data has been subjected to a number of
    processing steps to provide seamless and complete elevational surfaces for
    the globe. In its original release, SRTM data contained regions of no-data,
    specifically over water bodies (lakes and rivers), and in areas where
    insufficient textural detail was available in the original radar images to
    produce three-dimensional elevational data. The CGIAR-CSI SRTM data product
    applies a hole-filling algorithm to provide continuous elevational surfaces.

  uncertainty: >-
    There are two primary sources of uncertainty in PaleoCAR reconstructions.
    The first is that the PaleoCAR algorithm attempts to select the most relevant
    three ring chronologies for reconstructing a particular variable of interest
    at a particular time. This selection process — here minimizing the predicted 
    residual error sum of squares (PRESS) statistic in a stepwise fashion — can 
    lead to different sets chronologies being selected for adjacent pixels in a 
    gridded reconstruction. Discrepancies between selected chronologies can 
    manifest as spatiotemporal "artifacts", or discontinuities (Bocinsky and 
    Kohler 2014:8). These are amplified by the chained mean-variance matching 
    technique (Bocinsky et al. 2016:10). Additional uncertainty is associated with
    the lack of fit in the regression models; fit decreases as fewer tree
    ring chronologies are available.
    
  methodSummary: >-
    For each pixel, for each year, the model selects the tree ring chronologies
    (within a 10-degree buffer of the Four Corners states; from the National
    Tree Ring Database) that best predict PRISM data for that location and uses
    linear regression to estimate the paleoenvironmental variable for that date
    and location.


    Because the Maize Farming Niche is based on direct precipitation, maize
    farming may be possible if other water sources are utilized (e.g., springs or
    rivers) or if precipitation is concentrated on fields through water
    diversion structures (e.g., *ak chin* fields) or geologically (e.g., sand dune
    fields).

    There are two primary sources of uncertainty in PaleoCAR reconstructions.
    The first is that the PaleoCAR algorithm attempts to select the most relevant
    three ring chronologies for reconstructing a particular variable of interest
    at a particular time. This selection process — here minimizing the corrected
    Akaike information criterion in a stepwise fashion — can 
    lead to different sets chronologies being selected for adjacent pixels in a

    technique (Bocinsky et al. 2016:10). Additional uncertainty is associated with
    the lack of fit in the regression models; fit decreases as fewer tree
    ring chronologies are available.
  methodSummary: >-
    In addition to reconstructions of calendar-year and growing-season precipitation,
    there are two substantial differences betwrrn PaleoCAR v2 and v3:
    
    - We used the detrended and indexed (standardized) series ('ARSTND') available
    from the ITRDB instead of the 'Standard' chronologies used in previous reconstructions.
    This led to four or fewer chronologies available for the reconstruction for the periods
    of 1–102 CE and 418–589 CE.
    - We selected models by minimizing the corrected Akaike information criterion in a
    stepwise fashion, instead of the predicted residual error sum of squares (PRESS) statistic.
    
    
    For each pixel, for each year, the model selects the tree ring chronologies
    (within a 10-degree buffer of the Four Corners states; from the National
